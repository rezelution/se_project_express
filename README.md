## Functionality

### üîê Authentication & Authorization

- Secure user sign-up and sign-in with email/password.
- Passwords are hashed before being stored.
- JWT-based authentication (expires in 7 days).
- All routes (except `/signin`, `/signup`, and `GET /items`) are protected by middleware.
- Unauthorized or invalid tokens result in a `401 Unauthorized` error.

### üë§ User Management

- Create new users with validated email and password.
- Password is excluded from all API responses.
- Modify user profile with `PATCH /users/me` (name and avatar).
- Get the current user's profile with `GET /users/me`.

### üß• Clothing Items

- Create a clothing item with name, weather type (hot, warm, cold), and image URL.
- Delete clothing items (only if the user is the owner).
- Like or dislike clothing items.
- Retrieve all items with `GET /items`.

### üå¶Ô∏è Weather Integration (handled via front-end)

- Front-end fetches real-time weather and filters clothes accordingly by weather type.

## Security

- **Helmet**: Secures HTTP headers against common threats.
- **Validator**: Ensures email, avatar, and image URLs are properly formatted.
- **Hashed Passwords**: Securely stores user credentials with bcrypt.
- **JWT Tokens**: Provides secure and stateless authentication.

## Error Handling

Centralized error handler supports:

- `400` - Validation and missing field errors
- `401` - Unauthorized access (JWT errors)
- `403` - Forbidden actions (e.g. deleting others' items)
- `404` - Resource not found
- `409` - Duplicate email on registration
- `500` - Server/internal errors

---

## Notable Code Features

### üß© Authentication Middleware (`auth.js`)

- Extracts and verifies JWT from `Authorization` header.
- Injects the decoded user ID into `req.user`.

### üßæ User Model Enhancements

- Added `email` (unique and validated) and `password` (hashed, hidden in responses).
- Custom `findUserByCredentials` method for login with password comparison.

### üëï Ownership Checks in Deletion

- Items can only be deleted by their owner (`403 Forbidden` if not).

### üß™ Validation on Updates

- `PATCH /users/me` uses Mongoose validators to ensure data quality.
