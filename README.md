## Functionality

### üîê Authentication & Authorization

- Secure user registration and login via `/signup` and `/signin`
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt before being stored
- JWT-based authentication with 7-day expiry
- Tokens returned to client, stored in localStorage
- Middleware protects all private routes
- Unauthorized access returns `401 Unauthorized`

### üë§ User Management

- `POST /signup`: Create new users (email, password, name, avatar)
- `POST /signin`: Authenticate and return JWT
- `GET /users/me`: Get current logged-in user's profile
- `PATCH /users/me`: Edit user name and avatar

### üß• Clothing Items

- `GET /items`: Public endpoint to get all clothing items
- `POST /items`: Create a new clothing item (auth required)
- `DELETE /items/:id`: Delete clothing item (owner-only)
- `PUT /items/:itemId/likes`: Like an item
- `DELETE /items/:itemId/likes`: Remove like from an item

### üå¶Ô∏è Weather Integration

- Weather data is handled via the frontend and used to filter clothing recommendations

---

## New Feature Highlights

- Added JWT-based **registration, login, and session authorization**
- Integrated **like/dislike system** for clothing items
- Enabled **profile editing** (name and avatar updates)
- Secure routes with ownership checks and user-based content access
- Extended schema validation for all endpoints and models
- **Centralized error handling** using custom error constructors and middleware
- **Request validation** using Joi and Celebrate in a separate middleware
- **Structured logging** implemented via Winston for both requests and errors

---

## Security

- **Helmet** for HTTP header protection
- **Validator** to ensure safe and well-formed inputs
- **Hashed Passwords** using bcrypt
- **JWTs** for stateless and secure session handling
- **Celebrate** + **Joi** to sanitize and validate incoming requests

---

## Error Handling

Supports standardized error responses via a centralized error handler:

- `400` ‚Äì Validation or bad input
- `401` ‚Äì Unauthorized (JWT missing/invalid)
- `403` ‚Äì Forbidden (ownership mismatch)
- `404` ‚Äì Resource not found
- `409` ‚Äì Duplicate registration
- `500` ‚Äì Server errors

---

## Notable Code Features

### üß© Authentication Middleware

- Extracts and verifies JWT from request headers
- Injects decoded user into `req.user`

### üë§ User Model Enhancements

- Custom static method `findUserByCredentials` for login
- Email and password fields with schema validation

### üíæ Ownership Checks

- Deletion and update routes require item ownership
- Forbidden requests return `403`

### üß∞ Centralized Error Handling

- Custom `NotFoundError`, `BadRequestError`, `UnauthorizedError`, etc.
- All errors funneled to one middleware for consistent responses

### ‚úÖ Request Validation

- All routes validated using Joi schemas
- Celebrate middleware ensures only valid data hits your logic
- Validator package ensures URL/email formatting

### üìã Logging

- Winston logger used to log all incoming requests and server errors
- Logs stored and formatted for easier debugging and auditing
